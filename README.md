# Basic Agent with Tool - Stock Price Fetcher

## Overview

This project implements a basic AI agent that fetches and visualizes stock prices using the yfinance API. The agent takes a stock ticker symbol as user input and returns the latest stock price along with a stock trend graph for the past month.

## Features

```
2. Enter a valid stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA).

3. The agent will fetch the latest stock price and display a stock trend graph.

## Example

Latest AAPL stock price: $150.75
```
(A stock price trend graph will be displayed.)
